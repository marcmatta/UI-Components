MMNumberField
=============

MMNumberField is a direct subclass from UITextField that can accept text from the Latin Decimal Set ([0-9] and '-' sign).
Its value can be set programmatically. To provide the user with more control over it, a maximum and a minimum value have been added as well.

Programmatically, one can choose to set the value in an animated fashion as well.

- TODO List:

  - Add a value change delegate method.

  - Find an alternative to forcing the UITextFieldDelegate to be the Number Field itself.

ENJOYYY !!!
